# Snapper 3 extensions

Building extensions is currently in late-state beta testing with some (a) developer and when the interface for this is done the instructions will be posted here. In broad strokes, building a plugin simply means sending a object which conforms to a Snapper3PluginProtocol, which Snapper 3 will then communicate with your tweak through. If you are a developer and interested in building a plugin, please email me at jontelang@gmail.com!
